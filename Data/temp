## Overview

The **EuroSAT dataset** is a public remote sensing dataset based on **Sentinel-2 satellite images**.  
It contains multi-spectral images covering **13 spectral bands** and consists of **10 land use / land cover classes**, each covering diverse geographical areas in Europe.  

The dataset is suitable for tasks such as **classification**, **segmentation**, and **change detection**.
