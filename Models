Models Directory
Overview

This directory contains all trained machine learning models used for the Land Type Classification project.
Since deep learning models are often large in size, the actual model files cannot be stored directly on GitHub.
Instead, they are hosted externally on Google Drive.

📁 External Storage (Google Drive)

All trained models are available at the link below:
