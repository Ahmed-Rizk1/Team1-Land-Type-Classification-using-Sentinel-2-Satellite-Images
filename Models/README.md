# 📂 Models Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all trained machine learning models used for the **Land Type Classification** project.  
Since deep learning models are often large, the actual model files are hosted externally on **Google Drive** instead of GitHub.

## 📁 External Storage (Google Drive)

All trained models are available here:
